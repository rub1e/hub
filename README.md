# A Digital Learning Hub

## Summary

Our vision of a digital learning hub is a peer-led learning environment that combines the open access of a public library, the learning environment of a classroom and the vocational opportunities of a workplace.

## Three connected spaces

**A public learning space** where the general public can come to learn with others in both informal peer-led groups and more formal expert-led classes.

**A classroom** where students can train to become software developers in a full-time coding bootcamp.

**A co-working space** where bootcamp graduates can gain experience and build a portfolio while working with a selection of startups and digital agencies.

## Peer led
The coding bootcamp curriculum is based on the one that has been successfully developed at Founders & Coders and is largely peer-led. Support comes from the bootcamp alumni and businesses in the co-working space, who receive subsidised rent in return for their involvement in the bootcamp.

## Staff requirements
Two full-time staff: A director of learning to run the coding bootcamp and a career advisor to place people into work. Part-time temporary posts for bootcamp alumni at London living wage.

## Size
Co-working for up to 24 people; a classroom for up to 16 people; a public space for up to 24 people. Approximately 300 sq.m. total.

## Sustainability
The bootcamp training and open-access learning space is provided for free. Income is from subsidised desk rental and from recuitment fees. A digital learning hub would be expected to become self-supporing within two years of operation and to then operate free of public funding.

## Track record
The Founders & Coders campus opened in January 2015. It closely follows the model outlined here and is expected to break-even ahead of schedue in 2016.
