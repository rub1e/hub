# A digital learning hub

## Background
Founders & Coders CIC is a social enterprise dedicated to providing exceptional training in web development and assistance in finding work, without charging its students (the *FAC Bootcamp*). We believe that access to life-changing education should be free for all—and nowhere is this more true than in the digital sphere. 

Our model is a sustainable one—students *graduate* and immediately become teachers, facilitating the training of subsequent students, as well as getting involved in our other activities. This largely peer-led model has allowed us to teach over 100 students in the past couple of years. 

    After students graduate, we encourage them to remain in our co-working space, where they can build a 
    portfolio under the guidance of more experienced mentors. We attempt to find projects that have social 
    impact. Clients are likely to include social enterprises, startups, local authorities and established 
    businesses. Graduates work freelance, starting at a London Living Wage rate, until they are ready to 
    start their own business or find employment. As long as they remain in the space, they are expected 
    to contribute to the learning of others.

##Objectives

Now that we have achieved financial sustainability for our organisation, we are ready to start working on extending our model. 

Our current objective is a huge step-change in the number of people we are able to reach. To achieve this, we are proposing the creation of a *three-tiered* space:

+ A classroom where students can train to become software developers in a full-time coding bootcamp;
+ A co-working space where bootcamp graduates can gain experience and build a portfolio while working with a selection of startups and digital agencies;
+ A public learning space where we can organise informal peer-led learning groups, public events and workshops.

## How will this work?

The requirements for a digital learning hub are broadly as follows:

**A suitable physical space**  
In order to house around 16 full-time bootcamp students and 24 working graduates and mentors, we estimate the minimum space required would be 200 sq m. In addition, we would need access to a shared-use space for running events and workshops for the general public.

**Staff**  
Because the bulk of the teaching is done by bootcamp graduates in exchange for the education they have received, staffing requirements are low. Only two permanent staff are likely to be needed—a director of learning to ensure quality across the bootcamp and public-facing activities, and a careers and recruitment consultant to help place people into work.

**Investment & income**  
The primary costs of the hub are the cost of the physical space, and the salaries of the Director of Learning and Careers Consultant. A small marketing budget might be needed to promote the public-facing courses, and some paid jobs could be made available to recent graduates at a Living Wage rate. 

A learning hub can be run with a variety of income models. Our current space in East London generates revenue from a combination of recruitment fees from employers and income from two sister companies that share our premises and both employ our gradutes and contribute to our running costs. But, a hub could also be funded from public sources or from a consortium of employers. It could also operate as part of an accelerator, providing technical talent for resident startups. 

In theory, a learning hub could be funded by fees from students, but this is a model that we are less keen on.

## Outcomes

Our goals with a learning hub are to: 

+ Find paid work as software developers for all bootcamp alumni who seek it;
+ Provide entry-level open-access courses to the general public, some of whom will go onto join a bootcamp;
+ Operating without the need for external funding within three years.

### Footnote: what students learn

Primarily, our students learn test-driven development using full-stack JavaScript, with skills well-suited to building modern, scalable, real-time web applications.
